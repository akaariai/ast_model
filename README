This experimental project includes a new model base class, ASTModelBase. The
ASTModelBase will rewrite the __init__ so that the standard setattr based
field value assigment is rewritten to:
self.f1, self.f2, ... = args

This fast-path is usable only when using args based initialization, and when
there are exactly as many args as there are fields in the model. This is the
case when fetching objects from the DB and not using .only() or .defer().

pre_init and post_init signals will not be sent for models using ASTModelBase.
This means that models using GenericForeignKeys or ImageFields will not work
correctly.

To use ASTModelBase, copy astmodelbase.py to your project root, and then in
models py, do this:
from my_project.astmodelbase import ASTModelBase

class SomeModel(models.Model):
    __metaclass__ = ASTModelBase
    ...


The speed differences for 30000 Foo10 object initializations is as follows:
    Raw init: ~2 seconds -> ~0.4 seconds
    From DB: ~3 seconds -> ~1.4 seconds

Without any signals in the project:
    Raw init: ~1.2 seconds -> ~0.4 seconds
    From DB: ~2.3 seconds -> ~1.4 seconds

Using __dict__.update in the asted init instead of the self.f1, ... = args:
    Raw init: ~0.5 seconds -> ~0.4 seconds
    From DB: ~1.5 seconds -> ~1.4 seconds

The __dict__.update will not call setattr if you have one defined in your
model. The self.f1, ... = args will call it.
